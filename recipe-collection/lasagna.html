    </ul>
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <h3>Ragu:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Heat oil in a large heavy based pot over medium heat. Add garlic, onion, celery and carrots. Cook for 10 minutes until softened and sweet – they should not brown (if they do, turn heat down).
        </li>
        <li>
            Add beef, turn heat up and cook the beef, breaking it up as you go.
        </li>
        <li>
            Once the beef has all turned brown, add the remaining Ragu ingredients EXCEPT the sugar.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir then adjust the heat so it is bubbling very gently. Place the lid on and cook for 1.5 - 2 hours, stirring every now and then, then remove the lid and simmer for 30 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            The ragu is ready when the meat is really tender and the sauce has thickened and is rich - see video for consistency (Note 6). Adjust salt and pepper to taste, and add sugar if required (Note 3)
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Cheese Sauce:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Warm milk up in a saucepan (optional - just makes sauce thicken faster).
        </li>
        <li>
            In a large saucepan, melt butter over medium low heat. Add flour and mix constantly for 1 minute.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour about 1 cup of the milk in, mixing as you go to incorporate into the flour mixture. Once mostly lump free, add remaining milk. Use a whisk if needed to make it lump free.
        </li>
        <li>
            Turn heat up to medium high. Stir occasionally at first then regularly after a few minutes until sauce thickens - about 5 - 8 minutes. It should coat the back of the wooden spoon.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove from heat, add cheese, nutmeg, salt and pepper. Mix until the cheese is melted. The Sauce should be thick but still easily pourable – the consistency of heavy cream (you need to be able to drizzle it over the Ragu when layering - see video). If it's too thick, add a splash of water or milk.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Assemble:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat oven to 180°C/350°F.
        </li>
        <li>
            Use a 33 x 22 x 7 cm / 13 x 9 x 2.5″ baking dish.
        </li>
        <li>
            Smear a bit of Ragu on the base, then cover with lasagna sheets. Tear sheets to fit.
        </li>
        <li>
            Spread over 2 1/2 cups of Ragu (enough to cover sheets), then drizzle over 1 cup of Cheese Sauce.
        </li>
        <li>
            Top with lasagna sheets (Note 7). Spread with another 2 1/2 cups of Ragu, then 1 cup of Cheese Sauce. Top with lasagna sheets then repeat 1 more time.
        </li>
        <li>
            Top with a 4th layer of lasagna sheets, then pour over the remaining Cheese Sauce.
        </li>
        <li>
            Sprinkle with Mozzarella, then bake for 25 minutes or until golden and bubbling.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stand for 5 to 10 minutes before cutting and serving, garnished with basil or parsley if desired.
        </li>
    </ol>
