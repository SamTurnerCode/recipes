        <li>
            2 cups beef stock
        </li>
        <li>
            1-2 tablespoons cracked black pepper to taste
        </li>
        <li>
            salt to taste
        </li>
        <li>
            1 roll ready-made puff pastry thawed
        </li>
        <li>
            1 egg beaten
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            In a large pot, heat a generous splash of olive oil.
        </li>
        <li>
            Coat the chuck steak in the seasoned flour then shake of excess.
        </li>
        <li>
            Fry the beef in the hot oil until golden brown all over. Remove from the pot and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            In the same pot, fry the onions until soft and translucent then add the garlic, rosemary and thyme and fry for another 30 seconds.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour in the tomatoes, stock and pepper and add the beef back to the pot.
        </li>
        <li>
            Reduce the heat and allow to simmer for 90 mins - 2 hours until the beef is soft and tender. Keep an eye on the beef while it's cooking and top up with stock if necessary.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pre-heat the oven to 180Â°c.
        </li>
        <li>
            When the beef is cooked, season to taste then place in an oven-proof pie dish to make a large pie, or smaller pie dishes for individual pies. Alternatively you can add a layer of pastry to the bottom of the dish as well to make an encased pie.
        </li>
        <li>
            Brush the edges of the dish with beaten egg and roll over the puff pastry. Trim the edges then brush with the remaining egg.
        </li>
        <li>
            Make a small incision in the centre of the pie to allow steam to escape.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place the pie in the oven and bake for 20-25 minutes until the pastry is golden brown and crisp.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove from the oven and serve.
        </li>
    </ol>
